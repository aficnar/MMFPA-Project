# MMFPA-Project
Final project in the graduate course "Mathematical Methods - Financial Price Analysis" at Columbia University

* For this project, as part of a team, I have developed and coded an automatic trading algorithm that, guided by statistical tests 
(variance ratio and push & response) analyzed actual high-frequency data on prices of certain commodity futures. 

* I coded this in Mathematica and optimized it so that the analysis of 30 years worth of data with 5 min resolution 
can be run on a personal computer. 

* Based on these analyses and using the "trend following" behavior, the code then simulated real-time trading, 
with the goal of maximizing the profit while minimizing drawdown. 

* My project ranked first in the class. 

* The interactive demonstration of the code is available on [GitHub Pages](http://aficnar.github.io/MMFPA-Project/). However, 
Wolfram's CDF plugin is needed, which is currently not supported on Chrome browsers.
